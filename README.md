This is an Eko project. To learn how to interact with the code in the `src/` folder, see the [Eko Developer Documentation](https://developer.helloeko.com).

This README is left as a place to leave helpful hints about developing and maintaining the project for yourself or for collaborators.

## Developing the Project

The `eko-cli` is the command line utility you will use for building and testing the project. To see a current list of functionalities for your local `eko-cli` command line utility installation, make sure the command line is installed and type `eko-cli help`.
